# Big Idea in Simple Scripts

## motivation

There is a famous saying from Linus Torvalds which is `Talk is cheap, show me the code.`

It shows the importance of source code in computer science.

But computer science is growing so fast, we are building more and more subdiscipline to solve 
specific problems, more and more layers beyond other layers to solve complexity problems.
It may be difficult and too specific for programmers to read bare source code for big projects
like operating system, database, docker, webserver ...

The main purpose of this project is to show you the main theory in these great projects with only
a few line of scripts.
The scripts may be very basic and it skip many details, but hope it can give you some inspiration 
of these great projects.

PR is welcomed if you have other scripts of this kind.


## scripts

### Docker implemented in around 100 lines of bash.

### The easiest log-structured database

[db.sh](https://github.com/FingerLiu/BISS/blob/master/scripts/db.sh)

Explained in this book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)

### Simple http server implemented with netcat
